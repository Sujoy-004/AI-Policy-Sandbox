MVP plan for **AI Policy Sandbox**. Clear scope. Workable timeline. Deliverables per sprint.

# Goal

A web platform where developers upload models and datasets, run automated ethical audits (fairness, privacy, explainability), and get machine-readable audit reports with remediation suggestions.

# Core features (MVP)

* Model + dataset upload (API + UI).
* Standardized pipeline runner for audits.
* Fairness metrics (demographic parity, equalized odds, disparate impact).
* Explainability reports (SHAP summaries + feature importance).
* Privacy checks (PII scanner, basic differential-privacy flagging).
* Policy rule engine producing pass/fail + remediation hints.
* Audit report export (JSON + PDF).
* Authentication + role-based access (user, auditor).
* Minimal deployment (Docker + GitHub Actions).

# Tech stack

* Frontend: Next.js (React).
* Backend: FastAPI.
* DB: PostgreSQL.
* Model runtime: Python (scikit-learn + PyTorch support).
* Fairness libs: IBM AIF360, Fairlearn.
* Explainability: SHAP.
* Privacy tools: regex PII scanner, OpenDP concepts (flag only).
* Storage: S3-compatible (minio).
* CI/CD: GitHub Actions.
* Container: Docker.
* Orchestration (optional MVP): Docker Compose; K8s later.
* Monitoring/logs: Prometheus + Grafana; Loki for logs.

# Architecture (high level)

1. Frontend calls Backend APIs.
2. Backend persists metadata in Postgres and stores files in Minio.
3. Worker service (Celery + Redis) runs audit pipelines in isolated Docker tasks.
4. Worker produces report artifacts stored and linked.
5. Policy engine evaluates metrics and generates remediation.

# Data and test inputs

* Synthetic datasets with controlled bias (for validation).
* Public datasets: Adult Census Income, COMPAS (where permissible).
* Template models: logistic regression, random forest, small NN.

# Metrics (success)

* Audit latency: < 5 min for datasets ≤100k rows.
* Report completeness: fairness + explainability + privacy flags present.
* False negative rate for bias detection on synthetic tests: <10%.
* UX: upload → report workflow in ≤6 steps.

# Security & compliance (MVP)

* TLS for transport.
* RBAC for access.
* No storage of raw PII by default (masked unless explicitly allowed).
* Audit logs immutable.

# 10-week sprint plan (MVP)

Week 1 — Project setup

* Repo, infra IaC skeleton, Docker Compose, CI pipeline skeleton.
* Minimal Next.js + FastAPI hello endpoints.

Week 2 — Storage + auth

* Postgres, Minio integration.
* JWT auth + RBAC.
* File upload endpoints.

Week 3 — Worker + pipeline scaffold

* Celery+Redis worker.
* Pipeline interface for model+dataset ingestion.
* Sample job run that returns success.

Week 4 — Fairness metrics core

* Implement demographic parity, disparate impact, equalized odds.
* Unit tests with synthetic biased datasets.

Week 5 — Explainability integration

* SHAP integration for scikit-learn models.
* Produce summary visual + numeric export.

Week 6 — Privacy checks + PII scanner

* Regex PII scanner.
* Simple DP flagging (epsilon warnings).
* Add privacy section to report.

Week 7 — Policy engine & remediation rules

* Rules mapping metrics → pass/fail + actionable hints.
* Rule editor UI (basic).

Week 8 — Report generation + exports

* JSON + PDF report generation.
* Storage and retrieval endpoints.
* Frontend report viewer.

Week 9 — Testing, UX polish, synthetic dataset suite

* End-to-end tests.
* Create synthetic dataset library and validation suite.

Week 10 — Deployment + monitoring

* CI pipeline to build images.
* Deploy Docker Compose to a VPS.
* Prometheus + Grafana dashboards.
* Final acceptance tests.

# Deliverables by end of MVP

* Working web app: upload model+data → run audit → view/download report.
* Automated test suite with synthetic bias tests.
* CI pipeline and Docker Compose deployment.
* Documentation: README, API spec, audit metric definitions, policy rule handbook.

# Scale roadmap (post-MVP)

* Multi-language model runtime (ONNX).
* K8s + autoscaling.
* Interactive visual explainers.
* Advanced DP implementation.
* Plug-in marketplace for custom audit rules.
* Enterprise features: SSO, audit trails compliant with standards.

# Risks & mitigations

* False positives/negatives in fairness metrics. Mitigation: test against synthetic controls and document limits.
* PII exposure. Mitigation: default masking, retention policies, opt-in for raw data.
* Large-scale jobs timeouts. Mitigation: job queuing, chunking, sample-based prechecks.

# Acceptance criteria (MVP)

* Demo: upload a trained model and dataset (≤100k rows), run audit, produce JSON+PDF report in under 10 minutes.
* Pass synthetic bias detection tests.
* Report contains fairness numbers, SHAP summary, and at least 3 remediation suggestions when violation detected.

# Immediate next steps (do this now)

* Initialize repository and create sprint-1 issues: infra, auth, upload API, basic UI shell.
